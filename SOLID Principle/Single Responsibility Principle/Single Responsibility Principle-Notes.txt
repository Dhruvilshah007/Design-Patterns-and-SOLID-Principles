There should never more than one reason for a class to change




AwesomeClass that talks with Server,

Protocol change
Message Format change(Json/XML)
Communication Security change


So, if we have 3 separate responsibilities than we should have 3 separate class/modules
Our class should only provide focused specific single functionality
