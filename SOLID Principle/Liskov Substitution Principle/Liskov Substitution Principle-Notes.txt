This principle states that we should be able to use subclass or child class object wherever base
class object is expected.

And this substitution should not alter desired properties of the program.


That means if the base class object was providing a specific behavior and if that base class object

is now substituted with a child class object, that behavior should not alter.

Okay, so what is expected to happen in that particular code should happen even if we change the base

class object with the child class object.
