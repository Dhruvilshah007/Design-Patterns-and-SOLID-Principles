Statement-Clients should not be forced to depend upon Interfaces that they do not use(Clients should not have to depend on methods that are defined in interfaces that they don't use.)

It means interface pollution
-We should not make our interfaces bigger
-We should not cram methods that are unrelated in a one big interface and make all other classes in our software system or in our module implement that interface.


Signs of Interface pollution

-Classes have empty method implementations.
-Method implementations throw UnsupportedOperationException(or similar)
-Method implementations return null or default/dummy values.


Break bigger Interfaces

It is telling us to break those bigger interfaces so that the methods or behaviors or contracts that are defined in a particular interface are cohesive, that are related to each other.
And we don't run into a situation where a class is forced to provide an implementation for a method for which it doesn't make any sense.
