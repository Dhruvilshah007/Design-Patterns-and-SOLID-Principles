It deals with process ofcreation of objectsof class

Can we simply use new operator?

Well, technically you can.

You have to use new operator in order to create objects in Java language.

However, there are multiple additional requirements that are placed when we are doing a real life application development or project development.

For example, your object may need multiple other objects before it can be created.

There may be multiple steps that are needed before you can create an object, you may need to read some data from a file.

You may need to query a URL to get some data, and from that you have to create your final object.

So there are multiple steps there.

Sometimes you may have a requirement that there should be only one object of your class in the entire application because that class may be representing something like a configuration.

So you want only one object available in your entire application from which a configuration can be read.
