Implement a Builder

1)We start by creating a builder

-Identify the "parts" of product & provide methods to create those parts.
-It should provide a method to "assemble" or build the product/Object.
-It must provide a way/method to get fully build object out.Optionally builder can keep reference to an product it has built so the same can be returned again in future.


2)A director can be a separate class or client can play the role of director.
