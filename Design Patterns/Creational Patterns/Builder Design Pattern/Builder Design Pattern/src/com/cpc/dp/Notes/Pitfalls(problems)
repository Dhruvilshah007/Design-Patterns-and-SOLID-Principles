Pitfall consideration points

-like number of new classes that had to be added.
-the impact or the effort that is required to Refactor your existing code.
-the complexity to understand a particular pattern.


Issues:

-A little bit complex for new comers mainly because of 'method chaining',where buiilder methods return builder object itself.
- Possibility of partially initialized object; user code can set only a few or none of properties using withXYZ methods and call build().If required properties are missing, build method should provide suitable defaults or throw exception.
