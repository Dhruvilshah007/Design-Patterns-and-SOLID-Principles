So prototype is a creational design pattern.

Now, what prototype does is that it uses object cloning.So if you are familiar with object class in Java, you will remember that it has a protected method called as clone.

Now what clone method does is that it clones the existing object, so it will create a copy of your existing object and return it.

So that is one way to create an object and prototype design pattern basically uses this clone method in order to create objects of a class.


Builder - We have complex constructor and builderallows us to work with that.
Prototype-It allows to altogether skip using constructor

Builder - We can create a builder as separate class and so i can work with legacy code.
Prototype - It work using clone method, and needs to modify existing code so may not workwoth 			legacy code.

-So using prototype with legacy code may not be always feasible or possible.
