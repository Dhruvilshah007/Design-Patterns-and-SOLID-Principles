Why we use factory method?
->We want to move object creation logic from our code to a separate class.
->We use this pattern when we do notknow in advance which class we may need to instantiate beforehand & also to allow new classes to be added to system & handle their creation without affecting client code.
->We let subclasses decide which object to instantiate by overriding the factory method.
