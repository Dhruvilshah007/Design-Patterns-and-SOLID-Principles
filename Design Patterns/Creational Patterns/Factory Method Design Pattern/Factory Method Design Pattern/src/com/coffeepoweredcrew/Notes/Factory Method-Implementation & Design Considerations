Implementations Considerations

->The creator can be a concrete class & provide a default implementation for the factory method.In such cases you'll create some "default" object in base creator.
->You can also use simple factory way of accepting additional arguments to choose between different object types.Subclasses can then override factory method to selectively create different object for some criteria.


Design Considerations

->Creator hierarchy in factory method pattern reflects the product hierarchy.We typically end up with a concrete creator per object type.
->Template method design pattern often makes use of factory methods.
->Another creational design pattern called "abstract factory" makes use of factory method pattern.
