Implementation Considerations

->Simple Factory can be just a method in existing class.Adding a separate class however allows other parts of your code to use simple factory more easily.
->Simple factory itself doesn't need any state tracking so its best to keep this as a static method.

Design Considerations

->SF will in turn may use other design pattern like builder to construct objects.
->In case you want to specialize your SF in subclasses, you need factory method design pattern instead.
