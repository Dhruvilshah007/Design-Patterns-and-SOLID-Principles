Implementations Considerations

->Factories can be implemented as singletons, we typically ever need only one instance of it anyway.But make sure to familiarize yourself with drawbacks of singletons.
->Adding a new product type requires changes to the base factory as well as all implementations of factory.
->We provide the client code with concrete factory so that it can create objects.


Design Considerations

->When you want to constrain(limit) object creation so that they all work together then abstract factory is good design pattern.
->Abstract factory itself uses factory method pattern.
->If objects are expensive to create then you can transparently switch factory implementations to use prototype design pattern to create objects.
