Pitfalls

->A lot more complex to implement than factory method.
->Adding a new product requires changes to base factory as well as ALL implementations of factory.
->Difficult to visualize the need at start of development and usually starts out as a factory method.
->Abstract factory Design pattern is very specific to problem of "product families".
